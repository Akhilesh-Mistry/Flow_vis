# Flow_vis
Basic flow element visualisation in Python

This code creates a plot to show individual or combinations of a few fundamental flow types.
It was an assignment in my first year coding unit at university, originally in C where tecplot would handle creating graphs.

Using matplotlib's plotly and streamplot, this exercise was made easy.
